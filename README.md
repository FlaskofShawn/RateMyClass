## Idea

We want to build up a mobile version of Rate My Class. The goal of our app is identical to the website “rate my professor”. In our app, users can select the course they will take in our app. App backend will fetch the corresponding data on the selected course and return some basic information about the course back to the user. After finishing the course, the user can leave a reaction or comment on this course and professor. This information will be saved to the server, and when others add this course later, these comments will also be fetched and displayed.

## Technology chosen and how they can help

Database Tech related to Local DB or Firebase (Project 2 & Project 3)It can help us to push data into the cloud, and keep other users in sync with the latest data. Also Firebase can provide a great authentication tool.Navigation among different pages (Project 2)It can help users switch among different pages. For example, the user can view the introduction of one teacher and step into another page which may include more detail.

## Challenges we foresee running into

+ We might need some time to learn Filebase.

+ We might spend some time on designing the data structure with Firestore on Firebase.

## A roadmap of how your group will successfully accomplish the final project

+ Figure out the main components of the app, including navigation graph, activities and layout files, and database api. Labor Division.
+ Finish implementation of key functionality on different branches: write reviews and rates course.
+ Merge components implemented by different members. Test the app as a whole.
+ Make Mini-Technology Demo
+ Prepare for the Presentation video
